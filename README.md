## Actionable Recommendayions
* To improve the analysis result, I think a better text mining method will work, such as not only considering one word token search, but using ngram words to filter topics.
* Finding better topic could better analyze the geographical spread in tweets, which can make the analysis more clear and more logical.
* Many tweets have the same user_id but different profile, which could be problem. This time I use max function to extract one user name for each user id. Next time, I should use create time to find themost recent identity.
* User location variable I pick might not be a good indicator to find where exactly the post is made since the users might move; however, using place information of the tweet does not work either since there are lots of missing value. Finding a better way to profile their location could be a huge improvement in location analysis.
